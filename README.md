## Packaging

In order to use ``multi_loc``, run ``pip install -e .`` in this directory for
whatever conda environment you desire. This will install the package in editor
mode so that any changes made will be accounted for in the package. In order
to see the changes in a Jupyter notebook, you will have to reload the package
or restart the kernel.
