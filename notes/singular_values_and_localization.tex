\maketitle

We have two ensembles representing the same system.
The ensemble $X$ is a coarse representation of the state, but has many ensemble members.
The ensemble $Z$ is a fine representation of the sates, but has few ensemble members.
\[
\dim{X} = N_x, N_{ex}
\]
\[
\dim{Z} = N_z, N_{ez}
\]

In order to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the sample correlation of $X$, we take the singular value decomposition of $\tilde{X} = {(N_{ex} - 1)}^{-1/2} (X - \bar{X})/ \sd(X)$, where $\sd(X)$ is the standard deviation of each element of $X$.
\[
U_x S_x V_x^T = \tilde{X}
\]
This means that,
\[
U_x S_z^2 U_x^T = \hat{C}_x
\]
where $\hat{C}_x$ is the sample correlation of $X$.

We want to then use $U_x$, or its leading columns, to estimate the leading $U_z$.
To do this, we interpolate $U_x$ to the $z$ space and then use QR factorization to ensure the interpolated $u_x$'s are orthonormal:
\[
U_{x} = \interp (U_x)
\]
\[
U_{xi}, R = \QR (U_{xi}).
\]
We then must choose how many of the columns of $U_{xi}$ should be used.
The best way to make this choice is unclear.
A few ways that I am considering are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Keep $U_{xi}$ based on the cumulative sum of their corresponding eigenvalues.
\item Keep $U_{xi}$ based on the rate of change of their corresponding eigenvalues.
\item Keep $U_{xi}$ based on some measure of the length scale produced by the low rank approximation of $\hat{C}_x$ and the residual.
\item Keep $U_{xi}$ based on how orthogonal the interpolated vector is in $z$ space before orthogonalization.
\end{enumerate}
It should be noted that keeping all columns can be detrimental to the assimilation process.
If some of the columns of $U_{xi}$ are representing small scale structures, then in the following steps they will still be used to represent some of these small scale structures.

After choosing which columns of $U_{xi}$ to keep, we must determine what eigenvalues they should have.
We do this by taking $\lambda = u_{xi}^T \hat{C}_z u_{xi}$ as the eigenvalue of $u{xi}$ for our approximation of $C_z$.
Alternatively, we can take $\lambda = {(\tilde{Z}^T u_{xi})}^T (\tilde{Z}^T u_{xi})$ where $\tilde{Z}$ is defined similarly as $\tilde{X}$.
This will give us the leading eigenvectors and an approximation of their eigenvalues of $C_Z$.

These eigenvectors and eigenvalues represent the large scale structure of the problem.
To then find the small scales of the problem, we take
\[
C_z^\bot = C_z^\parallel - \hat{C}_z
\]
where
\[
C_z^\parallel = U_{xi} \Lambda_{xi}  U_{xi}^T
\]
and $\Lambda_{xi}$ is the diagonal matrix with the $\lambda$s described above on the diagonal.
We can then localize $C_z^\bot$ to get at the small scales that are represented in $Z$.

We must choose how to localize $C_z^\bot$.
One reasonable expectation is that the scales in $C_z^\bot$ will be shorter or similar to $N_z/N_x$.
This choice will also be affected by the choice of how many columns of $U_{xi}$ to keep.
Once the localization matrix $L$ is chosen, we can then generate our localized correlation matrix as:
\[
C_z^{loc} = C_z^\parallel + L \circ C_Z^\bot
\]
and the corresponding covariance matrix as:
\[
P_z^{loc} = D_z C_z^{loc} D_z.
\]
where $D_z$ is the diagonal matrix with sample standard deviations of $Z$ on the diagonal.

We can then find the leading eigenvectors and eigenvalues of $C_z^{loc}$:
\[
Q \Lambda Q^T = C_z^{loc}
\]
and use them to transform the $z$ variable.
First, we must calculate a whitening transformation
\[
T_w = \Lambda^{-1/2} Q^T
\]
and its right inverse
\[
T_w^i = Q \Lambda^{1/2}
\]
and the singular value decomposition
\[
U \Sigma V^T = R^{-1/2} H T_w^i.
\]
We can then define transformations for both $z$ and $y$
\[
T_z = V^T T_w
\]
\[
T_y = U^T R^{-1/2}
\]

We then know $z^* = T_z z$ and $y^* = T_y y$ have identity covariance matrices and
\[
y^* = \Sigma z^* + \epsilon^*
\]
\[
U^T R^{-1/2} y = \Sigma V^T \Lambda^{-1/2} Q^T z + \epsilon^*
\]
\[
y = R^{1/2} U \Sigma V^T \Lambda^{-1/2} Q^T z  + \epsilon
\]
\[
y = R^{1/2}R^{-1/2} H Q \Lambda^{1/2} \Lambda^{-1/2} Q^T z  + \epsilon
\]
\[
y = H z  + \epsilon
\]
The question is: can I do this better?
Specifically:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Can I calculate the eigenvectors and values of $C^{loc}$ without generating $C^\parallel$ or $C^\bot$ explicitly?
\item Can I calculate the eigenvectors and values of $P$ from those of $C$ without generating $C$?
\item Can I calculate the singular vectors and values of $R^{-1/2} H T_w^i$ from the singular value decomposition of $R$, $H$, and $T_w^i$?
\end{enumerate}
